# Add remote repository (create this on GitHub first)
git remote add origin https://github.com/sai45-oss/safecommute-ai.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## üì• Method 2: Clone from Bolt (if available)

Some Bolt instances provide a git URL:

```bash
# If Bolt provides a git URL, clone it directly
git clone <bolt-git-url> safecommute-ai
cd safecommute-ai

# Add your GitHub remote
git remote add github https://github.com/sai45-oss/safecommute-ai.git

# Push to your GitHub
git push github main
```

## üåê Create GitHub Repository First

Before pushing, create the repository on GitHub:

1. Go to **https://github.com/sai45-oss**
2. Click **"New"** (green button)
3. Repository name: `safecommute-ai`
4. Description: `üöÄ AI-powered real-time transportation safety dashboard with crowd monitoring, route optimization, and voice commands`
5. Make it **Public** (great for portfolio!)
6. **DON'T** check "Add a README file" (you already have one)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If you get authentication errors:
```bash
# Use personal access token instead of password
# Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
# Create a new token with repo permissions
# Use token as password when prompted
```

### If you get permission errors:
```bash
# Make sure you're the owner of the repository
# Or use SSH instead of HTTPS:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:sai45-oss/safecommute-ai.git
```

### If files are too large:
```bash
# Remove node_modules if accidentally included
rm -rf node_modules
git rm -r --cached node_modules
git commit -m "Remove node_modules"

# Add to .gitignore (already included in your project)
echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After pushing, verify everything worked:

1. **Check GitHub repository**: Visit https://github.com/sai45-oss/safecommute-ai
2. **Verify all files are there**: README.md, package.json, src/, server/, etc.
3. **Check commit message**: Should show your detailed commit message
4. **Test clone**: Try cloning in a different directory to make sure it works

```bash
# Test clone in a different location
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/sai45-oss/safecommute-ai.git test-clone
cd test-clone
npm install
npm run dev
```

## üöÄ Next Steps After Successful Push

1. **Add repository topics** on GitHub:
   - react, nodejs, typescript, transportation, ai, real-time, dashboard

2. **Deploy your app**:
   - Use the DEPLOYMENT.md guide included in your project
   - Try Netlify, Vercel, or Railway for easy deployment

3. **Share your work**:
   - Add to your portfolio
   - Share on LinkedIn/Twitter
   - Include in your resume
